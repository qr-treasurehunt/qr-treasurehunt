## 🔧 Quick Tips

**Creating hunts:**
- Choose recognizable, safe locations
- Take photos from the hunter's perspective

**During the hunt:**
- Scan QR codes in the correct order - the app will guide you if you scan the wrong one
- If you accidentally find a future QR code, don't worry! The app will tell you to keep looking for the current location

**Technical notes:**
- All data stored locally in your browser
- Use same device for creating and running hunts
- Data persists until browser storage is cleared

**Troubleshooting:**
- QR won't scan? Check lighting and hold camera steady
- Photos not showing? Use same browser/device
- Wrong order? Use reorder arrows in database
